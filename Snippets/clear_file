#clear_file
#Script snipplet that clears the text or the characters of the script but 
#leaves the original file as blank file

FILE=foo #here you may enter the file you may to cleanup

cat /dev/null > $FILE

#or if you want to leave the last or the first n lines of the original file

LINES=n

if [ -n "$1"  ]
then
lines=$1
else
lines=$LINES
fi   #you may give $LINES as argument to the script

touch foo.tmp
tail -n $lines $FILE > foo.tmp #for cutting of the last n LINES
head -n $LINES $FILE > foo.tmp #for cutting of the first of n LINES

cat /dev/null > $FILE 
less foo.tmp > $FILE
rm foo.tmp
#i suggest that to clean up the temporary file also and write the last $LINES back to the original logfile
