Bashtools is a collection of working scripts and a bunch of ideas that are not implemented or
only partly implemented to make the daily life as an administrator a bit easier.

Most scripts are SUSE-specific and may or may not work with your linux setup.
You are welcome to change scripts acording to your needs and write comments
or request for features. But i am not prommisse to implement those features.

!!! Note: That some Scripts are working perfectly fine and some are not. !!!

!!! Note: Please read and at least try to understand what a script is doing before running it.
Don't blame me if something went wrong and broke your system. I give absolutely no warenty
to this Collection of "Software". !!!
