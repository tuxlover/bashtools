This is just an other Script idea.
Bekka is a backuptool for both SUSE and Debian/Ubuntu as
i use both systems.

!!!NOTE!!! that bekka is still development work and not even ready to run.
It is expected that things are not working probertly and maybe crach or
freeze the system or even causes serious data loss.

How does bekka work:
Bekka first tries to find datas which are not owned by any package.
than copies these files in a seperated directory as well as a file
list structure and packs them as tar.gz file.

Bekka also will backup and download packages installed and tar.bz2 them.
So if things went wrong after upgrading a system a recovery is still possible.

Other things Bekka will backup:
Users /home and /root directories. Save a branch of /etc like git and restore
them.

Save the MBR 

Do backups based on given timeintervalls or at time marks. Choose Backup
directories. 


If you are a programmer and like to help out with things i welcome you to
help me with your ideas and inspirations or showing me how things can be done
or can be done better.
